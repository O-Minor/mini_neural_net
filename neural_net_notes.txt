changing the block size on line 38 gives these errors
block size 3 - no errors (original value)
block size 4:
line 74, in <module>
    h = torch.tanh(emb.view(-1, 30) @ W1 + b1)
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RuntimeError: shape '[-1, 30]' is invalid for input of size 1280
block size 2:
line 74, in <module>
    h = torch.tanh(emb.view(-1, 30) @ W1 + b1)
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RuntimeError: shape '[-1, 30]' is invalid for input of size 640
first hypothesis: [-1, block_size * 10] will fix this

did not work said can't multiply it with W1
second hypothesis: anything that is 30 should be 10 * block_size
so I made a new var called ten_blocks to put in both that 30 and the 30 in W1
!! this worked for block_size = 2 and 4
(4 has problems over fitting it gave 3 that already existed 2 were the same (jolteon))


thing to make better: instead of 28 make the relevant list give its length
as a variable and put that inplace of the 28
